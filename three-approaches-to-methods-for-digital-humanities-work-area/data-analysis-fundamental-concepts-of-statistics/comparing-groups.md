# Comparing groups

![​​Age at death distributions for Finnish males and females](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LPB0-GYwxbJd7xOS0FD%2Fuploads%2F40q4PyUzBdojzGivyxok%2Fimage.png?alt=media\&token=449d7db5-0243-45ea-83d2-63a3477f5843)

Picking up where we left off and jumping straight into analysis, from the measures of central tendency depicted above, we can infer that in general, female Finns seem to live quite a bit longer than male Finns, with for example 50% of females living to at least 81 years old (their median age at death), while for male Finns the median age at death is only 73. Further, from the shape of the distribution and the quartiles (25% and 75% equivalents of the 50% median), it can be inferred that the lifespans of Finnish males vary more than those of females. Particularly the first 25% quartile for males is very much to the left of that of females, meaning that a much larger proportion of men die early in their lives.

In the case of data describing complete populations, this is basically all there is to comparing them: either plot the distributions and compare visually, or calculate e.g. averages and variances and compare them. However, in practice again things get a lot more complicated due to needing to compare groups based on smaller samples.
