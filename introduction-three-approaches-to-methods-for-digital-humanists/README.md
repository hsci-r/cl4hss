## Three approaches to methods for digital humanities - what to learn if you're a humanist?

1. Knowledge of easy to use end-user data processing and visualisation tools
   * Easy to use for their intended purpose, but limited
2. Knowledge of the fundamentals concepts of programming
   * Frees you to process your data more efficiently
   * Allows you to more freely apply visualisations etc based on ready libraries and tutorials on the Internet
3. High-level understanding of what types of things can be accomplished with advanced CS methods
   * To be able to communicate in collaborative projects

### Digital humanities as the programming humanist

"Do you have to know how to code? I’m a tenured professor of digital humanities and I say “yes.” So if you come to my program, you’re going to have to learn to do that eventually." - Stephen Ramsay: Who's In and Who's Out, position paper at the “History and Future of Digital Humanities” panel at the 2011 mla

### Digital humanities as culturomics

### Digital humanities as multidisciplinary collaboration

"Our mission is to produce, **through the lens of humanistic inquiry, new modes of thinking in design and computer science** to serve data-driven research in the humanities. We believe that humanistic inquiry, grounded in interpretation, has much to contribute to the development of technologies if they are to help us reveal ambiguity and paradox, allowing human-scale exploration of complex systems." - About -page of the Humanities + Design research laboratory at Stanford

> Deep and significant progress in social science, in other words, will require not only new data and methods but also new institutions that  are designed from the ground up to foster long-term, large-scale, multidisciplinary, multimethod, problem-oriented social science research. To succeed, such an institution will require substantial investment, on a par with existing institutes for mind, brain, and behavior, genomics, or cancer, as well as the active cooperation of industry and government partners.

## Don’t get carried away by fancy methods!

1. Your dataset must be applicable to the methods you choose. Complex methods often make presuppositions about the data they apply to - if you don’t understand these deeply, you’ll end up with invalid results
2. In typical DH research, 90% of your time will go to gathering and understanding the data and transforming it into a form you can use - using complex methods, another 90% of your time may go to altering them to fit your data, and it’ll run out
3. Complex methods are often unnecessary for DH work. On the contrary, often simpler methods are actually better.

## Assignments

* Answer the course background [questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/gQpLPyOVV4ZvtL1x1)
* Look over the final projects from last year. Select the project that interests you the most. Post a short message on the [\#introductions](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=introductions&team=T276JCMEU) channel on the course [Slack](http://meth4dh.slack.com/) to introduce yourself and to describe why you chose those that project.
* Read up on [the history of humanities computing](https://jiemakel.gitbook.io/meth4dh/which-of-the-digital-humanities#assignment-1). Be ready to discuss in groups on the next lecture.
