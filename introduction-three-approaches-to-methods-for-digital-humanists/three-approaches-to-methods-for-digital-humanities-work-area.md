## What should be taught under humanities computing

This is also not a new question. Already in 1987

The Vassar Workshop generated considerable debate on questions such as whether humanities students need to learn programming, whether to teach programming before or after introductory packaged programs, and the depth of knowledge required in related areas such as statistics. The arguments reflected two distinct philosophies concerning the goals of training humanities students in computing

But what should the nature of this training be? This is the question considered by the first panel at the Vassar Workshop. The panelists agreed that computers and the humanities courses must provide two things: \(1\) familiarity with a range of computer applications in humanities disciplines, in order to acquaint students with the range of possibilities for computer use in humanities research as well as methodology; and \(2\) training in computing skills relevant to such applications.

The first of the two extremes may be called the "Holistic View" of computers and the humanities courses. In this view, such courses as introductions to computers and the humanities are a field of study.4 As such, these courses should do what any introductory course should do: provide a broad survey of the field and identify and expound the theoretical principles that inform its methodologies, in order to provide a foundation for further learn- ing and work.5 Emphatically and primarily, they are not intended to provide task-specific information and skills, but instead seek to lay the foundation for a possible lifetime of humanities research activity involving computers.

Substantial treatment of the methodological context and perspective within the humanities is also the basis of research in which the computer can play a role. Also involved is the acquisition of computing skills, but these are taught primarily to convey an understanding of the general principles they illustrate, rather than as ends in themselves.

According to the second view of computers and the humanities courses, the extreme opposite end of my continuum, the content of such courses is primarily intended to provide students with tools and skills to do one or more jobs. The overall intent is to familiarize students with existing tools and provide sufficient skills to enable them to automate phases of fundamentally traditional humanities research

The overall intent is to provide for immediate application of the computer to work and research in the humanities, without necessarily enabling students to develop additional skills later.

file:///Users/jiemakel/Downloads/DigitalHumanitiesPedagogy.pdf “\[technological\] skills training is not research training,” since “the knowledge gained is \[as\] transient” as the tools themselves, whereas “\[critical\] thinking skills are the most important because they are the most deeply embedded and the most transferable.”

> Scholars who are thinking of "computer projects" need, of course, some notion of what computers can and cannot do. But they need not be formally trained or even deeply knowledgeable about computer theory or technique. The reason for this is that we seem to be coming upon a second stage in using computers in the humanities; it is imagination, if only modestly informed, rather than technical expertness that is most needed now.

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00120965](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00120965) Such attitudes can be seen in a person who regards a word processor as something to boost the efficiency of a secretary or in someone who sets out to write an expert system by hiring someone else to do the programming. This tendency to consider the technology as separable from the research or instruction may be fostered by computing and the humanities courses which teach software use or programming in a kind of content-free environment that stresses technique and hopes that desirable and specific applications of the technique will somehow later emerge in students' minds.

On the other hand, when computer scientists entertain the notion of computing and the humanities they tend to regard the activity as somewhat uninteresting, even frivolous. Most computer scientists regard their discipline as primarily one of perfecting approaches to machine computation and they regard problem solving as an abstract task rather than one of developing specific application programs, especially applications in the humanities. In the world of computer science there is not yet an applied computer science specialization, though some engineering schools emphasize applications. If a computer scientist does become involved in humanities research or teaching it is often at a largely technical level, perhaps as a favor to a colleague.

If, for example, a course is taught by two persons, each specializing in either the idea or the technical aspect of the process, this team approach itself quickly communicates the idea that the subject matter being studied cannot easily be handled from a unified perspective by a single person. In other words, the idea is underscored that computing in the humanities is not an identifiable field but a loose, ad hoc amalgamation of at least two fields.

The key to integrating computer science and the humanities is to develop and promote projects and courses for which the involvement of the computer is integral rather than secretarial. In achieving this goal I would insist that some humanists need to develop their understanding of computer science as well as their computer skills and some computer scientists must become more involved in non-technical, humanistic research. The result would be a type of scholar in whom computational and humanistic interests combine to foster new directions and methods on the basis of traditional concerns.

Neural network design affords limitless possibilities to the person who wishes to interrelate humanities and computing

As soon as I had said that it would be a course on literature and computing, the immediate response of one person, delivered in a very knowing and almost amused manner was, "Oh, you mean the kind of course where you count words and decide if Shakespeare did it."
