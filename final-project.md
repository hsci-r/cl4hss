# Final project

To pass the course, you are required to demonstrate some grasp of actual digital humanities work. Therefore, you are tasked with **taking some dataset, and processing it in some way to yield an interesting analysis.** 

Potential datasets/APIs are for example:

* [Korp API](https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/FinCLARIN/KielipankkiHelpKorpWebService)
* [Finnish national gallery API / dump](http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/api/v2support/docs/#/download)
* [Schoenberg database](http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/schoenberg/ancillary.html?id=dla/schoenberg/data)
* [Cushman collection metadata](https://github.com/iulibdcs/cushman_photos)
* [WW2 covert support networks](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources#about-the-case-study)
* [Europeana APIs](http://labs.europeana.eu/api)
* [DPLA APIs](http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/)
* [The European Library API](http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/confluence/display/developers/API+Documentation)
* [Sydney Powerhouse Museum](http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/download.php)
* [EEBO-TCP Phase I](http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/eebotcp/)
* [ECCO-TCP](http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-ecco/)
* We also have a set of automatic transcriptions from 35,000 Finnish language TV and radio programs courtesy of the Finnish public broadcaster YLE available by asking

To return the assignment, you will need to upload your data, code and results into a [GitHub](http://github.com/)repository, link that repository with [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and give us the Zenodo [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) for your work. Include a description of what you've done, **following as best as possible the guidelines for open, reproducible research**:

1. which data did you use
2. what did you do to it \(and how can I reproduce it\)
3. what do the end results show
4. how would you continue the work \(towards academic meaning\)

**Further info:** your work doesn't need to be a full-blown pipeline from raw data to interesting results. It can be just some steps towards that. However, if you don't have end results, you need to very explicitly describe what your next steps would be to get those \(i.e. a plan for future research\).
