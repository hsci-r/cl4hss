## What should be taught to students in the humanities about computational humanities, and how?

This is also not a new question. Surveys canvasing computing courses aimed at people in the humanities were reported on in the "Computers and the Humanities" journal in [1971](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02402323), [1972](http://doi.org/10.1007/BF02403762), [1974](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02400288), [1978](http://doi.org/10.1007/BF02400087) and in a special issue wholly focusing on "teaching Computing to Humanists" in [1987](http://doi.org/10.1007/BF00517812). But more interestingly, in the same special issue, the article ["Computers and the Humanities Courses: Philosophical Based and Approach"](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00517809) already lays out many of the principles guiding also this present course. Summarising discussions held at a workshop the previous year, the article states:

> The Vassar Workshop generated considerable debate on questions such as whether humanities students need to learn programming, whether to teach programming before or after introductory packaged programs, and the depth of knowledge required in related areas such as statistics. The arguments reflected two distinct philosophies concerning the goals of training humanities students in computing.

Later in the article, these two approaches are further elaborated. Of the "holistic view", the following is said:

> The first of the two extremes may be called the "Holistic View" of computers and the humanities courses. In this view, such courses as introductions to computers and the humanities are a field of study. As such, these courses should do what any introductory course should do: provide a broad survey of the field and identify and expound the theoretical principles that inform its methodologies, in order to provide a foundation for further learning and work. Emphatically and primarily, they are not intended to provide task-specific information and skills, but instead seek to lay the foundation for a possible lifetime of humanities research activity involving computers. \([in context](https://hyp.is/_v57_s0-EeiXOR8kBVTlPQ/link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00517809.pdf)\) 
>
> Substantial treatment of the methodological context and perspective _within the humanities_ is also the basis of research in which the computer can play a role. Also involved is the acquisition of computing skills, but these are taught primarily to convey an understanding of the general principles they illustrate, rather than as ends in themselves. \([in context](https://hyp.is/IWmics0_EeiHgTfn7yhlDA/link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00517809.pdf)\)

The second, "Expert Users View" is described thusly:

> According to the second view of computers and the humanities courses, the extreme opposite end of my continuum, the content of such courses is primarily intended to provide students with tools and skills to do one or more jobs. ... The overall intent is to familiarize students with existing tools and provide sufficient skills to enable them to automate phases of fundamentally traditional humanities research ... to provide for immediate application of the computer to work and research in the humanities \([in context](https://hyp.is/UrLxZt3VEei0RE8UNZOHug/link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00517809.pdf)\)

Like those present at Vassar in 1986 \("Admittedly, most panelists and participants at the Vassar Workshop did not espouse either extreme opinion outlined above"\), this course also makes use of both viewpoints as follows:

## Three approaches to methods for digital humanities - what to learn if you're a humanist?

1. Knowledge of easy to use end-user data processing and visualisation tools
   * Easy to use for their intended purpose, but limited
2. Knowledge of the fundamentals concepts of programming
   * Frees you to process your data more efficiently
   * Allows you to more freely apply visualisations etc based on ready libraries and tutorials on the Internet
3. High-level understanding of what types of things can be accomplished with advanced CS methods
   * To be able to communicate in collaborative projects

In examining these viewpoints, the course moves gradually from a user perspective onto a more conceptual level. Yet in total, it must be said that the holistic view is on this course much more important, and thus also tools are taught more on a signposting level, more in the pursuit of charting a common landscape than providing deep education in any particular task. 

Similarly, instead of focusing on particular workflows for particular types of data, examples are instead taken from as different fields of the humanities and as different types of data and questions as possible. Through this, it is argued that a deeper understanding of the possibilities afforded by computation can be attained.

## Assignments

* Answer the course background [questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/gQpLPyOVV4ZvtL1x1)
* Look over the [final projects from last year](final-project.md#submissions-from-previous-years). Select the project that interests you the most. Post a short message on the [\#introductions](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=introductions&team=T276JCMEU) channel on the course [Slack](http://meth4dh.slack.com/) to introduce yourself and to describe why you chose those that project.
* Read up on [the history of humanities computing](https://jiemakel.gitbook.io/meth4dh/which-of-the-digital-humanities#assignment-1). Be ready to discuss in groups on the next lecture.
