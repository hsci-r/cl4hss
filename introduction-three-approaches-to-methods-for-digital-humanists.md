# Introduction: three approaches to methods for digital humanists

## Context: which of the digital humanities do methods relate to?





## Three approaches to methods for digital humanities

1. Knowledge of easy to use end-user data processing and visualization tools
   * Easy to use for their intended purpose, but limited
2. Knowledge of the fundamentals concepts of programming
   * Frees you to process your data more efficiently
   * Allows you to more freely apply visualizations etc based on ready libraries and tutorials on the Internet
3. High-level understanding of what types of things can be accomplished with advanced CS methods
   * To be able to communicate in collaborative projects

## Don’t get carried away by fancy methods!

1. Your dataset must be applicable to the methods you choose. Complex methods often make presuppositions about the data they apply to - if you don’t understand these deeply, you’ll end up with invalid results
2. In typical DH research, 90% of your time will go to gathering and understanding the data and transforming it into a form you can use - using complex methods, another 90% of your time may go to altering them to fit your data, and it’ll run out
3. Complex methods are often unnecessary for DH work. On the contrary, often simpler methods are actually better.

## Assigments

* Answer the course background [questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxYRuBppBjfqQ_MnFi6wWIb2ZVSpgXQNFYPc8HDjV8-u-vlw/viewform)
* Look over the final projects from last year as well as the datasets listed. Select the project and dataset that interest you the most. Post a short message on the \#meth4dh channel on the course [Slack](http://dhintros.slack.com/) on why you chose those two.
