## Terminology: representativeness

“The British National Corpus \(BNC\) is a 100 million word collection of samples of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources, designed to represent a wide cross-section of British English, both spoken and written, from the late twentieth century.”

* 90% written, 10% speech
* Written: 
  * 70-80% informative, 20-30% imaginative
  * 60% books, 30% periodicals, 10% miscellaneous
  * Informative: 5% natural and pure science, 5% applied science, 15% social and community, 15% world and current affairs, 10% commerce and finance, 10% arts, 5% belief and thought, 10% leisure
  * High, low and middle-level language
* Spoken: demographic sample of discussions, event-based sample of educational, business, public/institutional and leisure speech \(60% dialogue, 40% monologue\)

## Terminology: average

“The average life expectancy at birth is 63 years for males and 64 years for females”
