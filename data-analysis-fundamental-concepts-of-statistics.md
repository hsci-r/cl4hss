Statistics is about:

1. Understanding and describing groups
2. Comparing groups
3. Understanding relationships

Let's tackle these in turn:

## Understanding and describing groups

Consider [this dataset](https://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/StatFin\_\_vrm\_\_kuol/statfin\_kuol\_pxt\_12ag.px/) of the age at death of the two million Finns (2 027 385 to be exact) who died between 1980 to 2020. While aggregated in the original, the data essentially contains the following information:

<table><thead><tr><th>Sex</th><th data-type="number">Year of death</th><th data-type="number">Age at death</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Male</td><td>1980</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>Male</td><td>1980</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>Male</td><td>1980</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>Female</td><td>1980</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Male</td><td>1981</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>...</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr></tbody></table>

As a table, this tells us information about each individual. Further, we might order the two million rows by for example Age at death to find out the longest-living people for this time period:

<table><thead><tr><th>Sex</th><th data-type="number">Year of death</th><th data-type="number">Age at death</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Female</td><td>2000</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>Female</td><td>2005</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>Male</td><td>2009</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>Female</td><td>2015</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>...</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr></tbody></table>

However, what if we want to look at the data as a whole, to see what it tells us about the lifespans of Finns as a whole? For this, we need to turn to statistics. Let us start with a simple visualization that just takes all two million people and plots their ages at death in increasing order:&#x20;

![Ages at death of two million Finns, ordered by age at death](<.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)

While this is not the way these types of data are usually presented, what does this visualization tell us? First, one can read proportions out of it. Because the people are ordered by age at death, looking at the midpoint of the graph (around the 1st millionth person) and looking at the age recorded there (around 77), we can say that 50% of Finns live to be older than 77. This works for any percentage: looking at around 100 000 (5% of 2 000 000) and finding the number 41, we can say that only 5% of Finns die before reaching that age, while looking at 1 800 000, we can conclude that only 10% of Finns live longer than 90 years.&#x20;

This works the other way around as well. For example, looking at age 40 and finding the number 100 000 (5% of 2 000 000), we can say that only 5% of Finns die before reaching 40. If we want to know the proportion of Finns who die between 40 and 80, we look up 80 (at about 1 200 000 or 60% of 2 000 000) and can calculate that 60%-5%(the proportion from 0 to 40)=55 per cent of Finns die in that time period.&#x20;

So, only 5% of Finns die within the first 40 years of their lives, while 55% die in their next 40. Projecting this information back into the graph, we can see that in the horizontal bands where the graph moves up quickly, there are few people. In the bands where it moves up slowly, there are many more people.

To get a better overview of when people usually die, we can calculate the distribution of the data over the Age at death. What this means is that we take each Age at death, and count how many people die at that age. The resulting table looks like this:

<table><thead><tr><th>Age at death</th><th data-type="number">Number of peoplle</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>112</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>109</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>...</td><td>null</td></tr></tbody></table>

Plotted visually, this table looks as follows:

![The number of people dying at each age](<.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

From this visualization we can immediately see multiple things:

1. Many people die in the first year of their lives
2. After that, there is a small chance of dying before reaching 30, which seems to be very low between 1-15 and then increase somewhat in the late teen years.
3. The average age at death by natural causes seems to be somewhere around 80 years, but there is a large variation of 10-20 years around that as well.

This last observation takes us to a side path on summary statistics.

### What is average

Before we get into the details, consider for a moment what you'd deduce from being told that the average height for adult Finns is 173 centimetres? Perhaps that about half of Finns are over 173cm tall and half under, and that 173cm is itself the most common height? You'll also have an inbuilt ideation of the variance - that there will be quite many people 160cm or 180cm in height, but much fewer people less than 150cm or over 190cm. All of these ideations depend on the fact that [height is normally distributed](https://ourworldindata.org/human-height#height-is-normally-distributed), i.e. the distribution of heights looks something like this:&#x20;

![Height distribution of Finns](<.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)

With such data, summing it up in terms of an average value and the breadth of variation around it tells us everything we need to know about the data, and yields our intuitive understanding of what they mean in practice.&#x20;

Note that even when not often given, an understanding of the breadth of variation is still crucial. For example, currently we're about ten times likely to meet a person who is about 170-180cm in height than to meet someone who is less than 160cm. If the variation was double, we'd only be twice as likely to meet someone between 170-180cm as someone less than 160cm (compare the black and red graphs below):

![What if there was more variance in people's heights?](<.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)



Okay, before I wrote that usually, our intuition on averages is that that is the most common value, as well as that 50% of values are larger and 50% smaller than the average. Before that, from the distribution plot of ages at death, I wrote that the average age at death by natural causes seemed to be somewhere around 80 years. However, if I calculate the arithmetic mean for the whole data, it turns out to be 73,82 years. And remember, from already the original plot we deduced that half of the people die before by age 77, while half live longer. Only by looking at which exact age most people died do we come close to 80, by getting 83 (67 943 people died aged 83). What does this all mean?

It means that **because our age at death data is not completely normally distributed**, there is no longer a single neat average that would sum it up nicely. Instead, we are left with multiple numbers that measure different things. Formally, these are called different measures of central tendency:

* The median of 77 tells us that 50% of people live at least to that age.
* The mode of 83 tells us that that is the most common age of death.
* The arithmetic mean of 73,82 tells us that if we removed all the variation and distributed lifetimes equally, each Finn would live 73,82 years.

When data is normally distributed, all of these measures point to the same number, yielding our intuition of what an average is. However, with non-normally distributed data, none of these measures anymore (even with a measure of variation added) sums up the whole truth of what goes on in the distribution.

What can one do with such data? First of all, one can look at the individuals. To see how they compare against each other with regard to all the axes, it may make sense to order or sort the data according to an axis of interest, such as [lifespan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/154ShU7S8ykod5XU7N4zgygZOzXY4ztLCO\_KBD7U6zxI/edit#gid=1232246814) or [number of letters](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/154ShU7S8ykod5XU7N4zgygZOzXY4ztLCO\_KBD7U6zxI/edit#gid=1253333531). One can also visualize the data graphically, similarly ordered by [lifespan ](https://plot.ly/\~jiemakel/39/#/)or [number of letters](https://plot.ly/\~jiemakel/41/#/).

However, what if one is interested in not just individuals, but groups in the data, or alternatively the data as a whole? What can one say about the lifespans, or the number of letters written as a whole in this set of data? Looking at the [lifespan graph](https://plot.ly/\~jiemakel/39/#/) for example, one can say that the highest lifespan in the data is 95, while the lowest is 16. Also by finding the centrepoint of the graph and looking up the lifespan there, it seems that about half of the people live at least 65 years, while about half live less than that. However, from this view it is quite hard to say for example what the most common lifespans are. For this, it helps to _aggregate _the data by lifespan. In practice, this is done by taking all the lifespans appearing in the data, and counting how many times they appear. The result of this calculation is a [new table and visualization](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/154ShU7S8ykod5XU7N4zgygZOzXY4ztLCO\_KBD7U6zxI/edit#gid=904052074) describing the _distribution _of the lifespans.



* the average height for Finns is 172,74 centimetres
* the average height for Finnish males is 179,59cm
* the average height for Finnish females is 165,89cm

## Terminology: representativeness

‚ÄúThe British National Corpus (BNC) is a 100 million word collection of samples of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources, designed to represent a wide cross-section of British English, both spoken and written, from the late twentieth century.‚Äù

* 90% written, 10% speech
* Written:&#x20;
  * 70-80% informative, 20-30% imaginative
  * 60% books, 30% periodicals, 10% miscellaneous
  * Informative: 5% natural and pure science, 5% applied science, 15% social and community, 15% world and current affairs, 10% commerce and finance, 10% arts, 5% belief and thought, 10% leisure
  * High, low and middle-level language
* Spoken: demographic sample of discussions, event-based sample of educational, business, public/institutional and leisure speech (60% dialogue, 40% monologue)

## Terminology: average

‚ÄúThe average life expectancy at birth is 63 years for males and 64 years for females‚Äù
