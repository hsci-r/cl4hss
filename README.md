## Target audience

People of all levels in the humanities interested in digital methods. 

**Prerequisites:** Absolutely none.

## Course concept and learning goals

This course is an introductory signposting course on applying modern data processing to complex social and historical data. As such, it doesn't target the wide world of all [different digital humanities](http://j.mp/allthedh). Instead, it hems closely to [our local focus in digital humanities](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/helsinki-centre-for-digital-humanities/our-digital-humanities), which itself aligns with the long tradition of humanities computing. To make this clear, from this point on, the course will not refer to digital humanities, but to computational humanities.

As a signposting course, the course provides students with the knowledge they need to choose their own focus within computational humanities, also manifesting in the ability to choose where to go for [further knowledge](where-to-continue.md).

After this course the student understands the multiple ways in which methods benefit work within the computational humanities. She herself is able to use ready tools to work with data. In addition, she has attained knowledge of the fundamental concepts of programming, through which she can start to expand her capabilities, should she so choose. She also learns how open, reproducible research and publishing is done in practice. Further, the student gains a general literacy on advanced computer science methods applicable to computational humanities, and when to apply them. Finally, she learns to apply all of the above in practice in a small concrete computational humanities project.

## Format

This course is meant for both independent self-study \(reading up on only certain sections of the course\), as well as for completing as a MOOC with a group of likeminded students.
