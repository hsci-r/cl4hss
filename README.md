## Target audience

People of all levels in the humanities interested in digital methods. 

**Prerequisites:** Absolutely none.

## Course concept and learning goals

This course is an introductory signposting course on **applying modern data processing to complex social and historical data**. As such, it doesn't target the wide world of all [different digital humanities](http://j.mp/allthedh). Instead, it hems closely to [our local focus in digital humanities](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/helsinki-centre-for-digital-humanities/our-digital-humanities), which itself aligns with the long tradition of humanities computing. On the other hand, with regard to subfields of the humanities, the course makes no delineations, on the contrary arguing that by taking examples from different fields, a deeper understanding of the possibilities afforded by computation can be attained. For more details, see the [introduction](introduction-three-approaches-to-methods-for-digital-humanists.md).

As a signposting course, the course provides students with the knowledge they need to choose their own focus within computational humanities, also manifesting in the ability to choose where to go for [further knowledge](where-to-continue.md).

After this course the student understands the multiple ways in which methods benefit work within the computational humanities. She herself is able to use [ready tools](easy-tools-for-processing-and-exploring-data.md) to work with data. In addition, she has attained knowledge of the [fundamental concepts of programming](data-processing-fundamental-concepts-of-programming-for-humanists.md), through which she can start to expand her capabilities, should she so choose. She also learns how [open, reproducible research and publishing](open-reproducible-research-and-publishing.md) is done in practice. Further, the student gains a general literacy on advanced [statistical](computational-data-analysis-method-literacy/) and [computer science](computational-data-analysis-method-literacy/) methods applicable to computational humanities, and when to apply them. Finally, she learns to apply all of the above in practice in a [small concrete computational humanities project](final-project.md).

## Format

This course is meant for both independent self-study \(reading up on only certain sections of the course\), as well as for completing as either a contact learning or MOOC course with a group of likeminded students.

    2. Look over the [final projects from last year](final-project.md#submissions-from-previous-years). Select the project that interests you the most. Post a short message on the [\#introductions](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=introductions&team=T276JCMEU) channel on the course Slack to introduce yourself and to describe why you chose those that project.
    3. Read up on [the history of humanities computing](which-of-the-digital-humanities.md#history-of-humanities-computing). Be ready to discuss in groups on the next lecture.
* Friday 2.11. — [Different types of data, data quality, available open datasets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQBZw3s36wdPtPf3gTcz-PW5eRND-59TIrmZki67lR341ycKuQcO1TjvB0Vn6wYJsNySN8QOSzuEDyq/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) \([pdf](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_DI2ynbeQMigaQYbSryGUsTLGH-TKLF0dpzfs3_39Sk/export/pdf), [gd](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_DI2ynbeQMigaQYbSryGUsTLGH-TKLF0dpzfs3_39Sk/edit?usp=sharing)\)

    2. Read some background on visualisation for next week:
       * [What is Visualization Really for?](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.5670.pdf) sections 2.1-2.4 for a categorisation of different uses for visualisation.
       * [Perception deception](https://infoactive.co/data-design/ch17.html) & [Common visualization mistakes](https://infoactive.co/data-design/ch18.html) for learning to not trust visualisations blind.
    3. Read your first DH research article on [approaches to visualising relationships between different versions of texts](https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqx033).
