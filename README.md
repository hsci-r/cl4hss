## Target audience

People of all levels in the humanities and interpretive social sciences interested in whether computational methods might help them in their own work. 

**Prerequisites:** Absolutely none.

**Aside:** Why should you be interested in computational methods? Two reasons:

1. they may allow you yourself to do your work more efficiently, and
2. they may lead to completely new and powerful ways of addressing questions in your field

The probability of either of these happening very much depends on what you are interested in, but not in any way that can be shortly enumerated. Instead, that is what this course aims at enabling you to discover yourself. 

## Course concept and learning goals

This course is an introductory course on **applying modern data processing to complex social and historical data**. As such, it doesn't target the wide world of all [different digital humanities and computational social sciences](http://j.mp/allthedh). Instead, it hems closely to [our local focus ](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/helsinki-centre-for-digital-humanities/our-digital-humanities)in Helsinki, which itself aligns with the[ long tradition of humanities computing](introduction-three-approaches-to-methods-for-digital-humanists/history-of-humanities-computing.md). 

On the other hand, with regard to subfields of the humanities or social sciences, the course makes no delineations, on the contrary arguing that by taking examples from different fields, a deeper understanding of the possibilities afforded by computation can be attained. For more details, see the [introduction](introduction-three-approaches-to-methods-for-digital-humanists/).

As a signposting course, the course describes the landscape of computational humanities and social sciences. It provides students with the knowledge they need to choose their own focus within it, also manifesting in the ability to choose where to go for [further knowledge](where-to-continue.md).

After this course: 

* The student understands the multiple ways in which methods benefit work within the computational humanities and social sciences. 
* She herself is able to use [ready tools](easy-tools-for-processing-and-exploring-data.md) to work with data. 
* In addition, she has attained knowledge of the [fundamental concepts of programming](data-processing-fundamental-concepts-of-programming-for-humanists.md), through which she can start to expand her capabilities, should she so choose. 
* She also learns how [open, reproducible research and publishing](open-reproducible-research-and-publishing.md) is done in practice. 
* Further, the student gains a general literacy on advanced [statistical](computational-data-analysis-method-literacy/) and [computer science](computational-data-analysis-method-literacy/) methods applicable to computational humanities and social sciences, and when to apply them. 
* Finally, she learns to apply all of the above in practice in a [small concrete computational humanities/social sciences project](final-project.md). 

Yet most importantly, after this course and utilising all of the above, the student is able to: 

1. make informed decisions on which computational approaches will be of use to herself, and
2. understand, follow and discuss the development of computational approaches within her field in general.

## Format

This course is meant for both independent self-study \(reading up on only certain sections of the course\), as well as for completing as either a contact learning or MOOC course with a group of likeminded students. For material relating to particular instances of this latter mode of study, see [here](course-instances/).

Workload-wise, the full course is rated at 5 ECTS, which officially translates to ~135 hours of study. However, ECTS workload ratings have always diverged both from reality, as well as student expectations. In practice, I expect the load to be some 60-70 hours, or about ¬Ω to ‚Öî of the official norm. Generally, courses at this workload-level seem to be evaluated by students as "moderate to heavyish" in workload \(because sometimes you can get 5 ECTS even for something like 25h or ‚Öï of the official norm, for example from just sitting in lectures 14 x 1¬Ω hours, and then doing a couple of hours of work on top of that!\)

## Practical matters

* The course has a Slack workspace at [clit4hss.slack.com](https://clit4hss.slack.com/) used for both returning some assignments as well as peer and teacher support. Please [join](https://join.slack.com/t/clit4hss/shared_invite/enQtODE2OTc5ODk3ODMwLTMyMzEyZmMzNDgwM2Y3NDhhNTE2ZjAwMzU5YjY3NzI3YzVjYjQ2YThkYjFjOWRiZWJiZTYyZDc4ZDY0YTAwYjk) it.
* For linking to quotes in their original context, the course uses [hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is). To be able to use this, you must [join](https://hypothes.is/groups/W6MAkGe8/meth4dh) the METH4DH group \(as well as register in general if you don't already have an account\). You also naturally need access to the sources \(most commonly through accessing them from a university network / VPN\).
* If you use the material for self-study and it ends up being useful for you, I'd appreciate a note about this. Feel free to send that either through Slack, e-mail, Twitter or wherever you [find me](http://iki.fi/eetu.makela).
