# Helsinki fall 2020

Zoom meeting for the course: [https://helsinki.zoom.us/j/68027991035](https://helsinki.zoom.us/j/68027991035). To get into the meeting, use the code 065380.

The course relies heavily on blended learning and flipped classroom techniques. Therefore, much work will happen outside of class, in interactive assignments, reading of literature, testing tools or creating presentations. Meetings will be used to give presentations, discuss, share knowledge and ensure understanding. Accordingly, after the first two weeks, we will fall into a schedule where meetings happen on each Thursday, while each Tuesday is reserved for doing the assignments for that week.

      * tabular data → map\(+timeline\) visualisations: ​[Carto](https://carto.com/)​
      * ​text →​ interactive explorative interface for linguistic study: [Voyant tools](https://voyant-tools.org/)​
      * ​big, preselected collections of text → interface for linguistic study: [Korp](https://moodle.helsinki.fi/korp.csc.fi) / [corpus.byu.edu](http://corpus.byu.edu/)​
      * If you're feeling explorative, feel free to also dig for more tools in [TAPoR](http://tapor.ca/home).
   2. Data acquisition:
      1. Hand-written text transcription: [Transkribus](https://transkribus.eu/)

   If you're short on inspiration, feel free to go through [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13I7svLlqrg7i0iisw2E_v48Gae5tnXVFWxmeHyGAKFU/edit#) hands-on tutorial covering OpenRefine, RAW and Palladio. Afterwards, find other people who experimented with the same tool on Slack. Together, prepare a short demonstration \(5-10 minutes\) of the tool for class, describing:

   1. What is the tool good for?
   2. What kind of data do you need for the tool to be useful? 
      1. What information does the data need to contain?
      2. What format does it have to be in?
   3. Your experience with the tool.
   4. For groups studying visualization tools, also read [Perception deception](https://trinachi.github.io/data-design-builds/ch17.html) & [Common visualization mistakes](https://trinachi.github.io/data-design-builds/ch18.html), and reflect on how likely it is that you could use the visualizations to deceive yourself

2. Regular expressions: Read the section on [regular expressions](../regular-expressions.md) and go through the assignments there.
3. Research on visualization tool development: 

   Read the following two articles on developing  tools for particular text-based humanities research questions:

   * [Visualizing Mouvance: Toward a visual analysis of variant medieval text traditions](https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqx033)

4. Research 2: read [this research article](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1405984111). Try to understand on a general level what is being done on a methodological level, and how that feeds into the content argument. There will be group work relating to this in the next meeting.
