{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Assignments given" %}
Two full weeks to do these, need to be done only by 21.11.:

1. Data cleanup: complete the [OpenRefine tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine).
2. Visualisation: Experiment with at least one of the following tools:

   * tabular data → chart visualisations: [RAW](http://rawgraphs.io/)​
   * tabular data → chart visualisations: [Voyager](http://vega.github.io/voyager/)
   * tabular data → chart visualisations: ​[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)​
   * tabular data → ​interactive map/network/timeline/list/facet visualisations: [Palladio](https://moodle.helsinki.fi/hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/)​
     * Palladio has [help pages](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/help/). There are also multiple tutorials on using Palladio, for example [this one](http://miriamposner.com/blog/getting-started-with-palladio/), or [this one](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources) which is particularly on network analysis.
   * tabular data → map\(+timeline\) visualisations: ​[Carto](https://carto.com/)​
   * ​text →​ interactive explorative interface for linguistic study: [Voyant tools](https://voyant-tools.org/)​
   * ​big, preselected collections of text → interface for linguistic study: [Korp](https://moodle.helsinki.fi/korp.csc.fi) / [corpus.byu.edu](http://corpus.byu.edu/)​
   * If you're feeling explorative, feel free to also dig for more tools in  [TAPoR](http://tapor.ca/home).

   If you're short on inspiration, feel free to go through [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13I7svLlqrg7i0iisw2E_v48Gae5tnXVFWxmeHyGAKFU/edit#) hands-on tutorial covering OpenRefine, RAW and Palladio.

   Afterwards, post a message on [\#tools](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=tools&team=T276JCMEU) on Slack detailing:

   1. What is the tool good for?
   2. What kind of data do you need for the tool to be useful? 
      1. What information does the data need to contain?
      2. What format does it have to be in?
   3. Your experience with the tool.

   If someone has already posted on the tool you tested, don't repeat them. Instead, add to what they've said in a thread.  
   \(also be prepared to discuss the tools in class\)

3. Programming: Go through the [fundamental concepts of programming for humanists](../data-processing-fundamental-concepts-of-programming-for-humanists.md) and complete the assignments there.
4. Regular expressions: Read the section on [regular expressions](../regular-expressions.md) and go through the assignments there.
5. In preparation for the lecture on 21.11., read [this research article](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1405984111).

Form a group with all the other people who selected the same articles. For class, prepare a presentation on them, detailing:

1. How do the two articles relate to each other? 
2. Research questions - What are the humanities research questions? Do the projects also target computer science research questions? If so, what? What is the relationship between the CS and humanities research questions?
3. Data - How has the data used been gathered? What are the data sources used? How has the data been processed? Is the data available for others to use?
4. Methods - What methods do the projects apply? How do the methods support answering the research questions?
5. Partners - What is the make-up of the projects? Which disciplines are represented by the participants?
