   2. Experiment with at least one of the following tools \(~30-60min + ~15-30min\):

      1. Visualization:
         * tabular data → chart visualisations: [RAW](http://rawgraphs.io/)​
         * tabular data → chart visualisations: [Voyager](http://vega.github.io/voyager/)
         * tabular data → chart visualisations: ​[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)​
         * tabular data → ​interactive map/network/timeline/list/facet visualisations: [Palladio](https://moodle.helsinki.fi/hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/)​
           * Palladio has [help pages](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/help/). There are also multiple tutorials on using Palladio, for example [this one](http://miriamposner.com/blog/getting-started-with-palladio/), or [this one](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources) which is particularly on network analysis.
         * tabular data → map\(+timeline\) visualisations: ​[Carto](https://carto.com/)​
         * ​text →​ interactive explorative interface for linguistic study: [Voyant tools](https://voyant-tools.org/)​
         * ​big, preselected collections of text → interface for linguistic study: [Korp](https://moodle.helsinki.fi/korp.csc.fi) / [corpus.byu.edu](http://corpus.byu.edu/)​
         * If you're feeling explorative, feel free to also dig for more tools in [TAPoR](http://tapor.ca/home).
      2. Data acquisition:
         1. Hand-written text transcription: [Transkribus](https://transkribus.eu/)
         2. Layout and text transcription: [OCR4all](https://github.com/OCR4all/getting_started)
         3. Keyword generation from text: [Annif](http://annif.org/)
         4. An [automated sound transcription tool](https://www.google.com/search?q=automated+sound+transcription)
         5. An automated image/video description tool
         6. Twitter archiving: [TAGS](https://tags.hawksey.info/)

      If you're short on inspiration, feel free to go through [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13I7svLlqrg7i0iisw2E_v48Gae5tnXVFWxmeHyGAKFU/edit#) hands-on tutorial covering OpenRefine, RAW and Palladio. Afterwards, find other people who experimented with the same tool on Slack. Together, prepare a short demonstration of the tool for class, describing:

      1. What is the tool good for?
      2. What kind of data do you need for the tool to be useful? 
         1. What information does the data need to contain?
         2. What format does it have to be in?
      3. Your experience with the tool.
      4. For groups studying visualization tools, also read [Perception deception](https://trinachi.github.io/data-design-builds/ch17.html) & [Common visualization mistakes](https://trinachi.github.io/data-design-builds/ch18.html), and reflect on how likely it is that you could use the visualizations to deceive yourself

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Assignments given" %}
For 18.11. \(in 1 week\):

1. Programming: Go through the [fundamental concepts of programming for humanists](../data-processing-fundamental-concepts-of-programming-for-humanists.md) and complete the assignments there.
2. Regular expressions: Read the section on [regular expressions](../regular-expressions.md) and go through the assignments there.
3. Research on visualization tool development: 

   Read the following two articles on developing  tools for particular text-based humanities research questions:

   * [Visualizing Mouvance: Toward a visual analysis of variant medieval text traditions](https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqx033)
   * [Rule‐based Visual Mappings – with a Case Study on Poetry Visualization](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cgf.12125)

   Now, think of a visualisation that would help you in your field. What information would it visualise? Prepare to discuss in class.

4. Research 2: read [this research article](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1405984111) which we went through quickly on the first lecture. Try to understand on a general level what is being done on a methodological level, and how that feeds into the content argument. There will be group work relating to this in the next meeting.

### Wed 13.11. Continuation of tool and dataset presentations, support clinic for programming

Due to not being able to go through all tools on the Monday session, about an hour of this session will be used to go through the rest. After that, I'll be available to help you do the programming assignments.
