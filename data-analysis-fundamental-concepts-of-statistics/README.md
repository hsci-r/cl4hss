# Data analysis: fundamental concepts of statistics

{% hint style="info" %}
Context note: this is a self-contained part of the CLIT4HSS course. You can use this to teach yourself some fundamental concepts of statistics. However, if you want to understand more broadly when you might want to use them, you're better off going through the whole course.
{% endhint %}

Statistics is about:

1. [Understanding and describing groups](understanding-and-describing-groups.md)
2. [Comparing groups](comparing-groups.md)
3. [Understanding relationships](understanding-relationships.md)

After learning these, you may also be interested in [where to continue learning](../where-to-continue.md).
