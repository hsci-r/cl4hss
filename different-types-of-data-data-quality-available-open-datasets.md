**Assignment**

1. Find a dataset that could be of interest to you in your final project. Post a message on [\#datasets](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=datasets&team=T276JCMEU) on Slack giving:
   1. A link to the dataset
   2. A note on why you selected it.
   3. A short description of what types of information the dataset contains, and what the structure of the data is
2. Find a potential source of bias in a dataset someone else picked. Reply to their message on Slack to let them know about it.
3. If you get a note of bias, respond back by thinking of ways of overcoming or surmounting it.
