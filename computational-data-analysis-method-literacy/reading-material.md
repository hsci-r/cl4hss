# Reading material focus questions

During the course, you will be given material to read before proceeding to the next part. Typically, these will be academic papers that make use of digital humanities methods. When reading such papers, we ask that you focus on at least:

* Research questions - What are the humanities research questions? Does the project also target computer science research questions? If so, what? What is the relationship between the CS an humanities research questions?
* Data - How has the data used been gathered? What are the data sources used? How has the data been processed? Is the data available for others to use?
* Methods - What methods does the project apply? How do the methods support answering the research questions?
* Partners - What is the make-up of the project? Which disciplines are represented by the participants?
