## Background

[http://fredgibbs.net/posts/coding-in-the-humanities](http://fredgibbs.net/posts/coding-in-the-humanities): as I continue to experiment with various text mining projects, and continue to fiddle with my digital history course, I am now convinced that basic techniques for data manipulation should be taught as part of the humanities curriculum. Firstly, itâ€™s as fundamental as any other skill related to reading texts \(broadly conceived\), including sorting and organizing source material. Of course not all humanists use texts as their primary object of inquiry, but because textual sources often feature prominently \(if not exclusively\) in research, humanists in general have much to gain by learning how to manipulate the growing body of digital texts with simple but powerful tools. Secondly, not only is data manipulation not antithetical to humanistic research methodology, but it facilitates exactly what the humanities are about: embracing multiple perspectives and engaging with source material in multiple ways. As more and more sources become available online as data \(not just as images\), humanists need tools to manage and explore it. As Ann Blair has recently described of the early modern period, information overload is hardly a new problem. But if the problem of abundance worries the humanist who relies on project-delimiting scarcity, it is a problem to be embraced rather than avoided.

[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02402344.pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02402344.pdf) In the Report of the Conference on Computer Technology in the Humanities 1 the committee on courses and curricula concluded that a first course in computer programming in the humanities should "provide extensive instruction and practice in programming. Insofar as possible, programming should be taught algorithmically ... rather than as aspects of a specific programming language. Such algorithms ... provide an abstract structure onto which any given programming language can be mapped. Hence, the logical aspect of programming, rather than the details of a programming language, is given primary emphasis, and thus the inevitable shifts from one programming language to another necessitated by a change in computer or in research goals are facilitated." \([in context](https://hyp.is/weuQ4s07EeiHoNf0oO2VNA/link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02402344.pdf)\)

A key problem in learning to program is frustration. There are few things so frustrating as being told that a comma is missing and then having tO wait 20 minutes before it can be fixed - or receiving an error message that requires the combined heads of two systems analysts to decode.

Logical errors - those where the actions of the program do not meet the intent of the programmer - are another matter. If logical errors were impossible, there would be nothing to learn in programming. To help correct logical errors FLOW provides a powerful trace feature. This feature allows the program to be executed one line at a time with the results of each line's execution immediately seen and the program corrected if necessary. The trace is detailed below.
